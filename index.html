										<h2><a href="https://i-risk.co.il/">Multilingual Risk Questionnaire for Domestic Violence Victims</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://i-risk.co.il/" class="image fit"><img src="images/irisk.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>🌟 Description:
										We developed a multilingual risk questionnaire to empower victims and their relatives to assess the risk status of marital relationships or family members independently. Teaming up with a colleague at Hilma, our solution combines expertise in domestic violence treatment with cutting-edge technology.
										
									</br>💡 Our Solution:
										Our questionnaire, crafted by experts, guides users through questions to collect data and index systems. Upon completion, users receive immediate feedback and personalized assistance. Utilizing innovative technology, the questionnaire ensures user privacy and safety by disconnecting and erasing responses after completion.
										
									</br>👥 Collaborative Effort:
										Partnering with a colleague enriched our project, combining expertise in technology and social services to address a critical societal issue while prioritizing user safety.
										
									</br>🌐 Impact and Future:
										Our solution represents a significant step forward in supporting victims of domestic violence. Moving forward, we're committed to refining and expanding to reach more communities and make a tangible difference.</p>
